## Permission

### INTERNET

Internet is required to get aircraft related data from servers.
This permission is mandatory, without internet access, the app will not work as I can't retrieve any data.

### ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION

This permission allows the app to obtain a rough estimation of your current location (2-4km accuracy).
If you grant this permission, the app can calculate and display how far an aircraft is away from you.
Granting it is optional, but will disable some features.

### POST_NOTIFICATIONS

This permission allows the app to notify you when a plane matches an alert you set up.
Granting it is optional, but will disable some features.

## Debug log

The app has a debug log feature that can be used to assist troubleshooting efforts.
This feature creates a log file that contains verbose output of what the app is doing.

It is manually triggered by the user through an option in the app settings.
The recorded log file can be shared through compatible apps (e.g. your email app) using the system's share dialog.
As this log file may contain sensitive information (e.g. details about files or your installed applications) it should
only be shared with trusted parties.
